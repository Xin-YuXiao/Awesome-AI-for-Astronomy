## About

This list tracks machine learning work in astronomy with public papers, linking public code where it exists. It emphasises foundation models, language models, agents and benchmarks released since 2021, together with established deep learning methods in each subfield. General astronomy resources are covered by [awesome-astronomy](https://github.com/jonathansick/awesome-astronomy), and classical astronomical data science by [awesome-astro-datascience](https://github.com/mpi-astronomy/awesome-astro-datascience).

> [!NOTE]
> - Papers are listed newest first within each subsection. The date column gives the month of the first arXiv version, or the publication year when there is no arXiv version.
> - Peer-reviewed venues are shown in **bold** when confirmed by the journal DOI, the official repository or the publisher page. Other entries show `arXiv` and the year. Oral, spotlight and award papers carry a separate tag.
> - Every arXiv identifier, DOI and repository link was checked against the paper page or the official repository before inclusion. Hovering over a paper title shows its summary.
