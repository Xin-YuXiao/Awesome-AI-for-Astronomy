# Contributing

Thank you for helping improve this list. Participation in this project is governed by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Inclusion criteria

1. The work applies machine learning or AI methods to astronomy, astrophysics, cosmology, heliophysics or planetary science.
2. The paper is publicly available (arXiv, journal or proceedings).
3. Public code, model weights, datasets or hosted services are strongly preferred and are linked in the Code and Links columns. A paper without a public artifact is accepted when it reports a clear methodological or scientific contribution, a benchmark or a survey; the web page can filter the list to entries with public code.
4. The venue is the peer-reviewed journal, conference or workshop that accepted the paper, confirmed by a DOI, the proceedings, the official program or the authors' repository. Otherwise the venue is `arXiv` with the year of the first version.
5. The work is not already listed. `scripts/build.py` rejects entries that repeat the title, arXiv link or DOI of another entry.

Software without an accompanying paper can be added to the Tools and Libraries section, linking to its official repository.

## How the list is built

All entries live in [`data/entries.yml`](data/entries.yml). `README.md` and the web page are generated from that file by [`scripts/build.py`](scripts/build.py), so please do not edit the tables in `README.md` by hand.

```bash
pip install pyyaml
python scripts/build.py          # regenerate README.md and _site/index.html
python scripts/build.py --check  # confirm README.md matches data/entries.yml
```

Pull requests are checked with `--check`, so commit the regenerated `README.md` together with your change to `data/entries.yml`.

The [AstroAI Today](https://xin-yuxiao.github.io/Awesome-AI-for-Astronomy/today.html) page is separate from the curated list. Every day the AstroAI Today workflow ([`scripts/today.py`](scripts/today.py)) searches arXiv for new papers that combine machine learning and astronomy, asks a language model to screen and summarise them, and stores the result in `data/today/`. The TL;DR lines and the weekly and monthly digests are written by DeepSeek V4.1 Flash (`deepseek-flash`, thinking at medium effort) when the repository secret `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` is set. The repository variable `LLM_REASONING_EFFORT` changes the effort (`low`, `medium`, `high`, `max`, or `none` to turn thinking off). Another OpenAI-compatible service can be used through the secret `LLM_API_KEY` and the repository variables `LLM_BASE_URL` and `LLM_MODEL`, and Claude through `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Without a key, papers pass a stricter keyword screen, the topic comes from keyword rules, and the TL;DR line comes from Semantic Scholar once it has processed the paper (the first sentence of the abstract is shown until then). A paper found there can be proposed for the curated list through an issue or a pull request like any other.

Once a month the Metadata Audit workflow ([`scripts/audit.py`](scripts/audit.py)) compares the entries still listed as arXiv preprints with arXiv and Crossref, and opens an issue listing papers that appear to have been published or retitled. Each finding is confirmed by hand before the entry is changed.

## Entry format

Add the entry to the most specific section or subsection in `data/entries.yml`, chosen by the task the work addresses. Foundation Models and Representation Learning is for pretrained or self-supervised models meant for reuse across tasks, not for every model that uses images or spectra. The order inside the file does not matter, since the tables are sorted newest first by the date of the first arXiv version.

```yaml
- name: ShortName               # optional model, dataset or benchmark name
  title: 'Full Paper Title'
  venue: NeurIPS 2025           # or arXiv 2025 when no venue is confirmed
  links:
    Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/XXXX.XXXXX
    Code: https://github.com/owner/repo
    Model: https://huggingface.co/owner/model
  desc: One sentence stating the method, the data and the scale.
  note: Oral                    # optional: Oral, Spotlight or an award, shown as a separate tag
  modality: [Images, Spectra]   # optional, see below
```

Rules for the entry

- Use the arXiv abstract page for `Paper` when one exists. The date column is derived from this identifier.
- Confirm the arXiv identifier against the paper page or the official repository README.
- Use the confirmed peer-reviewed venue. Use `arXiv Year` when no venue is confirmed.
- Use a label containing `Code` for source code links, so they appear in the code column and in the code filter of the web page. Label model weights `Model` and datasets `Data`, so the resource filter of the web page finds them. Other labels such as `Journal` or `Project` are shown as additional links.
- `modality` lists the kinds of data the work uses, drawn from `Images`, `Spectra`, `Data cubes`, `Time series`, `Tabular`, `Text`, `Point clouds` and `Simulations`. It is filled in for the Foundation Models and Benchmarks sections so far and is optional elsewhere.
- Keep the description to one factual sentence. Report data scale and model size when available.
- Quote the title with single quotes when it contains a colon.
- Leave out `name` when the work has no short name, rather than leaving the key empty.
- Change only the lines of your entry. Do not re-indent, re-quote or reformat the rest of `data/entries.yml`, so that the diff shows only the new entry.

Entries in Tools and Libraries, Communities and Groups and Related Awesome Lists use `name`, `url` and `desc`.

## Pull request checklist

- [ ] Every link resolves.
- [ ] The venue and year match the paper.
- [ ] `python scripts/build.py --check` passes. It also rejects duplicate titles, arXiv links and DOIs, and unknown modality values.
- [ ] One pull request adds or edits entries for one topic.
